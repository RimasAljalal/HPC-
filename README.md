# **EcoGuard: AI-Powered Deforestation Monitoring System**

EcoGuard is an AI-powered system designed to monitor and prevent deforestation activities in real-time. By utilizing satellite imagery, machine learning models, and advanced algorithms, EcoGuard aims to detect illegal logging, fires, and environmental threats to protect forests and support sustainable development.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze satellite images and detect deforestation patterns.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on a diverse dataset to improve model accuracy and reduce false positives.
- **Scalable Solution**: Can be expanded to monitor additional regions and integrated with other environmental data sources.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy use by local authorities and environmental agencies.
- **Future Developments**: Plans for High-Performance Computing (HPC) integration, soil sensor data, CCTV monitoring, and video processing capabilities.

## **Installation**

To set up EcoGuard on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/EcoGuard.git
   cd EcoGuard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from [insert dataset source].
   - Place the dataset in the appropriate directory (`/data/deforestation` and `/data/no_deforestation`).

4. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Test the Model**:
   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

## **Usage**

1. **Upload Satellite Images**: Upload new satellite images to the `/data/new_images` directory.
2. **Run the Model**: Use the trained model to predict deforestation activities.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
3. **View Results**: The predictions will be displayed in the terminal, and alerts will be sent to the configured email address.

## **Future Developments**

- **HPC Integration**: Enhance data processing speeds and scalability.
- **Soil Sensor Integration**: Monitor soil health to prevent desertification.
- **CCTV Integration**: Detect illegal activities using ground-level surveillance.
- **Video Processing**: Develop AI algorithms for continuous monitoring of environmental changes.
